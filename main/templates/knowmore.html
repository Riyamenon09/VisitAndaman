      <h2>Know More Mini India</h2>
      <p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an exquisite archipelago nestled in the southeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, are
         a union territory of India comprising over 570 islands, islets, and rocks. Known for their breathtaking natural 
         beauty, these islands offer a harmonious blend of tropical forests, crystal-clear waters, 
         coral reefs, and white sandy beaches, making them a paradise for nature lovers and adventurers alike. 
         The archipelago is divided into two groups: the Andaman Islands in the north and the Nicobar Islands in the south, 
         separated by the Ten Degree Channel. Port Blair, the capital, is a vibrant yet serene city with colonial influences and historical significance.

  <!-- Origin of the name -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Origin of the name</h2>
      <p>The name "Andaman" is believed to have been derived from the Malay word "Handuman", referring to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god. Ancient Indonesian and Malay seafarers used this term in early references to the islands. Over time, "Handuman" evolved into "Andaman."
The term "Nicobar" is said to have originated from the Tamil word ‚ÄúNakkavaram‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúland of the naked people‚Äù, as used in the 8th-century records of South Indian dynasties, particularly the Chola Empire.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <h2>Prehistoric & Indigenous History</h2>
      <p>Archaeological findings suggest that the Andaman Islands have been inhabited for over 30,000 years, primarily by Negrito tribes such as the Great Andamanese, Jarawas, Onge, and the reclusive Sentinelese, who are among the world‚Äôs last uncontacted tribes. The Nicobar Islands are home to the Nicobarese and Shompens, of Mongoloid descent. These tribes have lived in isolation, sustaining themselves through hunting, fishing, and gathering, preserving a way of life largely untouched by modern civilization.</p>

  <!-- Colonial Era & British Rule -->

    <div class="text">
      <h2> Colonial Era & British Rule</h2>
      <p>The British East India Company established the first penal colony in 1789 at Port Blair, but due to high mortality and resistance, it was soon abandoned. However, after the 1857 First War of Independence, the British revived the idea to use the islands as a penal settlement for political prisoners. The most infamous structure built during this time was the Cellular Jail, completed in 1906, also called "Kala Pani" (black waters), where hundreds of Indian freedom fighters were incarcerated under brutal conditions.</p>

      <h2>  Japanese Occupation (1942‚Äì1945)</h2>
      <p>During World War II, the islands were occupied by Japan, and the Indian National Army (INA), led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, briefly took symbolic control. Netaji even visited Port Blair in 1943 and hoisted the Indian flag, marking it as the first territory freed from British rule, even if temporaril</p>

      <h2>   Post-Independence</h2>
      <p>After India gained independence in 1947, the islands were officially merged with the Indian Union in 1950 and declared a Union Territory in 1956. Over the decades, development efforts have been balanced with conservation policies to protect the region‚Äôs indigenous populations and ecological diversity. Today, the Cellular Jail stands not only as a tourist attraction but also as a national memorial to Indian independence.</p>

      <h2>Biodiversity & Nature</h2>
      <p>With over 570 islands, the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago is a treasure trove of biodiversity. The region is covered with dense tropical rainforests and fringed by vibrant coral reefs that are teeming with marine life. It is home to numerous endemic species of plants, birds, animals, and marine creatures found nowhere else in the world. The islands support a delicate ecological balance and are a vital part of India‚Äôs environmental heritage. Protected areas like the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, Campbell Bay National Park, and Mount Harriet National Park play a crucial role in preserving this unique ecosystem. These efforts ensure the survival of species like the Dugong (sea cow), saltwater crocodiles, and many rare orchids and butterflies.</p>
